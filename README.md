## Major Topics and Keywords Covered

| Topic/Keyword | functionality |
| --- | --- |
| JavaScript |
| this | “This” keyword refers to an object that is executing the current piece of code |
| filter | The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function |
| map | map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element |
| ES6 Concepts utilized in this Repo |
| let | let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used |
| const | The const declaration creates block-scoped constants, much like variables declared using the let keyword |
| arrow functions | An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, with some semantic differences and deliberate limitations in usage |
| template literals | Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates |
| default parameters | Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed |
| object literals | An object literal in JavaScript allows us to create plain JavaScript objects. It consists of a list of key-value pairs, each separated by a comma and wrapped inside curly braces |
| rest | The rest operator is used to put the rest of some specific user-supplied values into a JavaScript array |
| spread | The spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected |
| destructuring assignment | The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables |
